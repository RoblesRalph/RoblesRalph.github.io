		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>I am a college student, taking a Web Development course, and as of now, there are some things I know about coding and making websites. I have also taken an animation course previously in Senior High School, so I know quite a bit of that as well.</h4>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Aside from that, I also love video games and music, as well as surfing the internet. I also love cartoons and movies (mostly animated ones). My dream is to learn as much as I can, graduate from college, and become a great programmer someday. I also have a minor interest in food and voice acting.</h4>
